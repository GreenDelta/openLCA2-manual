# Scripting in openLCA

openLCA provides powerful scripting capabilities to automate tasks, analyze models, and integrate
life cycle data into external tools or workflows. There are two main approaches for scripting:

- Jython (Python) scripting within the openLCA application itself

- Inter-process communication (IPC) using the openLCA API

Both approaches enable automation and interaction with openLCA models, but they differ significantly
in how and where scripts are executed, their use cases, and their limitations.

## Jython

[Jython](https://www.jython.org/) is a dynamic language that is embedded within the openLCA
application. It allows you to write scripts in Python that can be converted to Java (the language
used by openLCA) and executed within the openLCA application.

It‚Äôs ideal for small tasks, data extraction, custom calculations, or batch modifications within the
openLCA GUI. Since Jython runs inside openLCA, you have access to internal variables like the
current database connection and the graphical interface.

üìò We provide a dedicated manual for Jython scripting in openLCA, including real-world examples:
[Jython scripting manual](https://greendelta.github.io/openLCAJython-manual/).

You can also check out some examples on our
[GitHub](https://github.com/GreenDelta/openlca-python-examples/tree/main/Jython).

## Inter-process communication (IPC)

The IPC (Inter-Process Communication) protocol allows you to control openLCA from an external script
or application. This is especially useful for integrating LCA calculations into automated workflows,
external tools, or larger systems. The IPC protocol is language-agnostic and can be used by any
application written in any programming language (e.g. Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, .Net, Go,
etc.).

This protocol is provided by an openLCA server, which can either be a running instance of the
desktop application or a web server with an openLCA back-end. An application can connect to such an
IPC server to call functions in openLCA, perform calculations, or interact with the database
remotely.

üìò To get started, check out the official API documentation:
[openLCA IPC API](https://greendelta.github.io/openLCA-ApiDoc/).

You can also check out some examples on our
[GitHub](https://github.com/GreenDelta/openlca-python-examples/tree/main/Python%20IPC).

## When to use Jython vs. IPC

Both Jython scripting and IPC scripting offer powerful ways to interact with openLCA‚Äîbut which one
is right for your use case? The decision depends on factors like whether you prefer scripting inside
openLCA or from an external environment, the level of integration needed, and how your workflow is
set up.

To help you decide, we've created a comparison table that highlights the key differences between the
different approaches:
