A window will appear in which you can choose the name of your library as well as the allocation method. 
You can also choose to have the library include regionalization and uncertainty distributions. 
Note, that including regionalization and uncertainty distributions may result in your memory usage becoming very large. 
Once all settings have been selected as desired, click "OK" to create the library.
