# _New_ Libaries in openLCA

<div style='text-align: justify;'>

Libraries are a new feature in openLCA 2.0. They are a tool that allows faster impact calculations and the use of processes, flows, 
impact categories etc. across databases. The **faster impact calculations results** arise from **precalculated matrices** (see section "[Library file system](./file_system.md)" for more information). Databases can be exported as libraries and inversely these libraries can be added to existing databases. 
The data from these imported libraries can then be used normally in the database for LCA modelling.
Additionally, libraries allow for a better overview when using the graphical editor as some detail is hidden without compromising 
the accuracy of the impact calculations.

Using libraries allows also for a more accurate data exchange with the Collaboration Server as library data will not be exchanged but 
instead only referenced.
