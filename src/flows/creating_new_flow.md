**It is mandatory to define a reference flow property to proceed. However, you can change it afterwards.**

4. Click "Finish" to complete the flow creation process.

After clicking "Finish," a new flow window will open in the editor interface. Here, you can further specify and define the properties and attributes of the newly created flow according to your requirements.


_**Note:**_ If you want to organize flows into different categories, first choose to add a category (sub-category). This allows you to create a new category/folder under which you can then add flows to maintain organization.
