This manual focuses on openLCA 2, our latest version of the software. It elaborates on the new features and explains how to carry out the first steps in working with openLCA such as installation and importing databases. Further, this document provides an overview of openLCA operations and features including descriptions of how to use them. 

This manual is generated with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases) and allows you to navigate through the book chapters:

The left **sidebar** displays all chapters. Clicking on a chapter title loads to that specific page. The sub-chapters are collapsible, click on the arrow on the chapter title's right to display all of them. You can also browse them on the [Table of Content](./toc.md).

The sidebar may not automatically appear if the display window is too narrow, especially on mobile screens. In this case, you can tap the menu icon (three horizontal bars) at the top-left corner to open and close the sidebar.

You can use the **arrows buttons** at the bottom of the page to navigate to the previous or next chapter. Additionally, the *left and right arrow keys* on your keyboard serve the same purpose.

To enhance your reading and learning experience, we made the manual sections collapsible, allowing a customized exploration of topics based on your preferences.

The top menu bar presents icons for interacting with the book. The icons displayed will depend on the book’s generation setting.

Tapping the top bar will scroll the page to the top.


In some chapters we use collapse sections. You can open them by clicking on the respective icon &#x25B6;.
