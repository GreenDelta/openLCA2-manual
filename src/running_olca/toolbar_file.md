        - **Reset window layout:** Furthermore, you can reset your window settings if you encounter a bug or if you find yourself lost with the number of open windows.
                
        - **Download calculation libraries:** This option allows you to integrate fast calculation libraries for openLCA. This function is still developed currently.
    
        _**Note**_: You need to restart openLCA to activate configuration changes.         
    
           
    - **Experimental features:** These features are still in development, but you can already access them by checking this box. We welcome any feedback to further refine them. Here you can activate the novel social impact assessment feature.

    - **Import/Export:** Here you can change the ILCD Network settings (currently under development).

    - **Logging:** Here you can set what information should be written in openLCA's log file. You can also keep the log file opened permanently if you want.

    - **Number format:** If you are not a fan of the six-decimal display format, you can modify it here. This setting will not affect calculation results and it is just for your convenience, adjusting the format in the user interface. 
    
    In case you made a mistake here, "Restore Defaults" will always bring you back to the default settings.
    
- **Import:** See section "[Importing and combining databases](../databases/importing_and_combining_databases.md)"

- **Export:** See section "[Exporting data](../databases/exporting_databases.md)"
    
- **Exit:** This option closes openLCA, as well as clicking on the small cross at the right corner of openLCA.
