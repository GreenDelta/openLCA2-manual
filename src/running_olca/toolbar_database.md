# Toolbar: Database

_**Note**_: Almost all the functions described here can also be accessed via right click with mouse on the navigation panel.

The following options are available under "**Database**" when a database is opened:

-   **New Database**: For creating a new database, see section "[Creating a new empty database](../databases/create_database.md)" for details.
It is also
    possible to activate the "New Database" function by right-clicking the
    navigation window.

-   **Restore Database:** For restoring a database, see section "[Restoring a database](../databases/restore_database.md)" for details. 

-   **Backup Database:** Copy the database into an archive file to save it.

-   **Validate:** Checks the database about inconsistencies and creates a validation report.

-   **Copy:** Creates a copy of the active database.

-   **Rename:** Renames the active database.

-   **Delete Database:** Deletes the active database from openLCA. Please note, this action is irreversible!

-   **Close Database:** Closes the active database. Alternatively, opening another database will automatically close the active one.

-   **Check linking properties:** Performs a comprehensive provider check on the active database and displays the results in a table. It will show if processes lack a default provider, whether product or waste flows exist with multiple providers, if and which product flows have multiple providers and identifies provider linking options that are uncritical with the active database.

-   **Properties:** Shows the database's location on the computer and the type of the database.

-   **Compress database:** This function will remove deleted datasets from the active database freeing up space in the database. 
    
-	**Contents:** Under the two tabs, "_flows_" and "_processes_" are available. Clicking on them shows a list of all the flows or all the processes within the database. This option allows you to filter all flows using the CAS number or chemical formula.
