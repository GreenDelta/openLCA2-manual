# Inventory results

In the first two tables in "Inventory results" you find the list of all the input and output flows of the product system, showing the amounts and units for each on them. You can sort the flows alphabetically, by category, unit or amount, clicking on the corresponding header cell. Additionally, If you click on the arrow symbol before the flowâ€™s name in the Inputs or Outputs section, you will see all processes in the product system that use that specific flow, and thus contribute to its amount in the result.
