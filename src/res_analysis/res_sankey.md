-   "Focus" to focus on the process the calculation is based

-   "Minimap" to displays/hides the minimap

-   "Layout as tree" to update the order of the processes

-   "Settings of the Sankey diagram" to select the flow or impact and cut-off level to be displayed.
	
-   "Save as Image" to save the Sankey diagram as png file.
