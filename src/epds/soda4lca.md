# Using soda4LCA

<div style="text-align: justify;">

With openLCA v2.2, you can now access a wide range of ILCD nodes through the soda4LCA tool. This includes also various EPD-focused nodes, e.g. International EPD, ÖKOBAUDAT... The soda4LCA tool can be accessed by going to Tools > soda4LCA as seen below:

With an active database, it's possible, then, to import the results by right-clicking on the desired entry and selecting "import selected".

If you have imported an EPD, it shall appear under the "EPD" folder in the working database. If you have imported an impact category, it shall appear under the "impact categories" folder and so on. To integrate results of EPD into the product system, please refer to ["Using results of EPDs in the product systems"](./life_cycle_models.md) section. Make sure that you use the same impact method to calculate impacts as it had been used to generate the EPD. Otherwise the impacts of the EPD will not be taken into accout.
