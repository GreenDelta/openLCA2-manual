3.	It is now possible to export the completed EPD, by clicking on "File" and selecting "Export". Select "JSON-LD" and click on "Next". Your EPD should be selected. Click on "Finish". Your EPD is now saved in the folder you selected. That allows to exchange with EPDs and send them to responsible parties.
