3.	After all necessary impact categories are added, a full list of associated impacts can be seen. However, it is important to link the burdens to a specific flow that will represent a functional unit. Thus, an existing or a custom flow can be selected by right clicking the "Inventory results â€“ Outputs" field and selecting the right option from the list. Once finished, it is needed to right click on the target flow and set it as a reference. The amounts of the output flow must correspond to the original EPD or converted according to the new functional unit with all of the associated emissions.
