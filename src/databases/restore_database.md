# Restoring a database

Restoring a database allows you to import an entire openLCA database, with all elements, process datasets, models, etc., into the openLCA system you are currently working with. This is useful e.g. for restoring backups, or for migrating all LCA work from a project or colleague.

For restoring a complete database, you need a zolca file from openLCA. For example, most files provided by openLCA Nexus are zolca files (see ["openLCA Nexus"](../resources/nexus.md) section in "Resource" for mode details about downloading databases from our platform)

To restore a complete database follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the navigation window and choose "Restore database".

2. Select the zolca-format database file from you want to restore.

**_Note:_** The zolca file format was specifically developed by GreenDelta to compress and package openLCA databases, for backup and sharing purposes.

**_Note:_** The program decompresses the files into a different directory (C:\Users\NAME\openLCA-data-1.4). As a result, the original zolca file remains compressed and won't be directly affected by changes made to the database within the software
