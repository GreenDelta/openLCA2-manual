openLCA is a free and open source software. However, many LCA databases are not for free. GreenDelta has created [openLCA Nexus](<https://nexus.openlca.org/>), an online repository for making LCA data available to users. It contains free and "for purchase" data. Some are shown in the image below. 

Moreover, the Nexus website allows you to search for data sets in Nexus. It is also possible to filter data sets by the data provider, location, category, price and year of validity.

## Databases

openLCA offers the largest collection of data sets and databases worldwide for LCA software, some for purchase, some for free. Altogether, around 300,000 different data sets are available on [Nexus](../introduction/nexus.md).

Most databases support the same reference flows and impact assessment methods. Some databases are separate, and do not mix with the others. An example are Input/Output databases such as PSILCA, the SHDB, or exiobase.

## Accessing databases from openLCA Nexus

On Nexus, you can use the search engine and the "Map" feature to explore the content of the available databases.

    _Downloading a database from openLCA_

**_Note for macOS users:_** If you are using Safari, the browser will automatically unzip your downloaded zip files. However, you need the zipped file for import in openLCA (e.g. when you want to import JSON-LD, methods packages, ILCD...). You can solve this issue in two ways: 

1. Use another browser for downloads, where the zip-files are not automatically unpacked after successful download.

2. Zip the archives again by using a third-party tool, because the build-in archive tool from Apple will add additional resources to the zip-file that can create issues when importing the file in openLCA.
