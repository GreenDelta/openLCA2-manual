# Regionalized calculation

In openLCA, you can now assign locations to characterization factors and process inputs/outputs. These locations are then used in the new calculation, and shown in the reults. By default, for inputs and outputs, the process location is used, but you can specify a different location at the flow or even exchange level if needed.

More on regionalized calculation can be found in the "[regionalized LCA](../advanced_top/regionalized.md)" section.
