In openLCA versions from 1.x to the latest release, you could edit and create impact categories and factors within the impact assessment method tab. However, in version 2.0, this functionality has been separated, and now you can work with a distinct set of individual impact categories. You can edit their characterization factors, categories, flow properties, units, and uncertainty data in the "[Impact category tab](./impact_categories_tab_contents.md)".

In this section you can:

Here you can view and modify the name of the method, add a description, additional details or [tags](../cheat/tags.md), along with:

- Adding a source from the sources in the database. If unavailable, create a new source as described in "[Database elements](../databases/database_elements.md)".
- Adding a code (i.e., a short name for the category, useful in result views).

The image below shows an example of the General Information tab for the CML-IA baseline methodology from ecoinvent.
